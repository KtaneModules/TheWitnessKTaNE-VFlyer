    Complete this mysterious puzzle inspired by "The Witness" game.


    My first module and practically my first programming project as well, so expect
    the code to be DISGUSTING. It works, though ;P

    I''ll add more features and fix bugs as soon as I can :)


    Manual included in the mod file, I hope it gets published on ktane.timwi.de someday
