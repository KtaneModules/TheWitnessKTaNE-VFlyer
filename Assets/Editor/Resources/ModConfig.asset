  description: "...and a dream.\n\nComplete this mysterious puzzle inspired by \"The
    Witness\" game.\n\nmoduleID: thewitness\nCreated by: bmo22xd\n\n[b]WARNING: Module
    still in development[/b] \nMy first module and practically my first programming
    project as well, so expect the code to be DISGUSTING. It works, though I'd really
    appreciate some help in optimizing the script ;P\nI'll add more features, fix
    bugs and improve the manual as soon as I can :)\n\nManual included in the mod
    file, will soon get published on ktane.timwi.de :3\n\nSource code [url=https://github.com/PauGuri2002/TheWitnessKTaNE]
